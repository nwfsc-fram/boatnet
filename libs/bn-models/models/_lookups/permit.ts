/*
1. Vessel Covered
- Drop these ones off

2. Permit Rollovers - Vessel has high likelihood of fishing, just not at this time
- e.g. Nearshore - they fish hard, but they must do it in the summer, even
        though they're selected for Jan-Feb
        They will fish, just not yet

    Permit Rollovers
    - Vessel/Permit selected for Jan-Feb, but they don't fish those months
    - Logic
        -- When vessel takes trip with observer during selection
            period, need to know if they've had a landing
        -- If they have a landing during that period, then it
            won't rollover
        -- Otherwise rollover it over to what ???

3. Vessel likely not to fish
- Want to query if they're making landings so we could catch it
    and get an observer on there

4. Guranted will not fish

Permit Transfers
- How do keep track of permit's history?  Possible transfer types
    a. Transfer permit from boat A to boat B
    b. Transfer permit from owner C to owner D
    c. Transfer permit from boat A, owner C to boat B, owner D
    d. Transfer permit and/or vessel to new port group

Our permits approach:  consume all of the active and inactive
    permits from NMFS permits system

    A transfer would represent a closing of one permit record
        and an opening of a new record
