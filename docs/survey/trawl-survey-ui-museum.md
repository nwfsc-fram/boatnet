## Keyboard Exhibit

### Catch View
User clicks on a textfield and a keyboard appears, auto-filtering the listbox of values:

## Numpad Exhibit

All of the number pads used on the trawl survey backdeck software are the same. 

### Weights and Counts View
On this screen, the user starts typing in a value into the numpad, clicks OK, and it adds a new row to the table on the right.  You'll notice that the Weight button is selected, that toggles over to the Count button once the weight has been entered.

### Catch View
This number pad acts slightly different in that the user first clicks in the associated textfield (in this example, into the Fork Length field).  Then once a numeric value is entered and the OK button clicked, it enters that value back into the Fork Length textfield.

### Special Actions View
On this view, a user highlights the row of interest in the left-hand table, enters the value on the numpad, clicks OK, and the value then appears in the value column of the highlight row in the table

Below is the hauls view where a user can double click or highlight a row and click Select Haul (in lower right) to select that haul as the active haul
